**Reconstructing the Dimensionality of Cantor Numbers: A Systematic Hypothesis of 3.5D Topological Existence**

## About This Project

This repository presents a bold and original hypothesis:  
**Cantor numbers may fundamentally exist in a 3.5-dimensional structure**, where time acts as a hidden axis enabling topological closure.

This work was completed by **Shuming Liang**, a final-year undergraduate student from a Chinese university. It is an independent theoretical exploration combining insights from topology, set theory, and dimensional philosophy.

## Key Concepts

- **Instantaneous Cantor Numbers**: Constructed via diagonalization, but interpreted as time-slice outputs.
- **3.5D Space**: A semi-dimensional state where time intersects spatial slices, enabling continuous generation.
- **Dimensional Lifting**: Continuous movement in space creates semi-dimensional extensions (e.g., circle → spinning circle → sphere).
- **Cantor Set as 4D Closure**: Full Cantor structure only forms under time-aware continuity, implying a higher-dimensional truth.
